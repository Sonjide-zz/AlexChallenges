# Let's write two separate for loops.

1.  Prints out all the words in uppercase.
2.  Builds a new array of just the first two letters in each word. ("ca", "do", "av", "bo", "go".)

# Write a new for loop, using chessboardLength.

1.  Print out a row that's as long as specified.
    If it's a black square, print "X"
    If it's a white square, print "."
    So for an 8-long row, print ".X.X.X.X"
2.  A real stretch goal: put this for loop in another for
    loop. And print out a row for everything. So, if
    chessboardLength = 4, print:
    ".X.X
    X.X.
    .X.X
    X.X."
